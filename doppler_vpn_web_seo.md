### Optimized Full Description (For Website "About" or Features Overview)

**PRIVACY WITHOUT REGISTRATION**

Most VPNs ask for your email before protecting your privacy. Doppler doesn't.

Your device serves as your account. No email. No phone number. No personal information. Download, tap connect, and you're protected. Privacy begins the moment you connect—not after filling out forms.

**WIREGUARD ENCRYPTION — FAST & SECURE**

Doppler uses WireGuard, the modern VPN protocol trusted by security professionals worldwide.

Why WireGuard matters:
- Faster connections than legacy protocols
- Better battery efficiency on mobile devices
- Smaller, audited codebase = fewer vulnerabilities
- Military-grade encryption on every connection

Whether you're on home WiFi, a corporate network, or public hotspot—your data stays encrypted and your activity stays private.

**BUILT-IN AD BLOCKER**

Ads slow you down. Trackers follow you everywhere. Doppler stops both.

Our network-level ad blocking removes up to 75% of advertisements, trackers, and pop-ups before they reach your device. The result? Faster page loads, less data consumption, and cleaner browsing—without installing extra software.

Works across all browsers and apps automatically.

**CONTENT FILTER & PARENTAL CONTROLS**

Create a safer internet for your family.

- Block specific websites or entire categories
- Password-protect settings to prevent changes
- Adjust filtering as your needs evolve

Perfect for parents who want safer browsing for children, professionals who need to block distractions during work, or anyone filtering unwanted content across their household.

**DESIGNED FOR MINIMAL DATA COLLECTION**

Privacy isn't our feature—it's our foundation.

We don't log your browsing activity. We don't track websites you visit. We don't build profiles based on your usage. Our architecture requires minimal data by design because the app functions fully without knowing who you are.

**COMPLETELY FREE**

All Doppler servers are free with full functionality:
- Full WireGuard encryption
- Unrestricted speeds
- Unlimited bandwidth
- No premium tiers
- No trial limitations
- No feature restrictions

Get started with Doppler VPN. Secure browsing in one tap.
